-    React allows us to determine and built the best architecture for our team
-    Already known by the entire team, thus making it the easiest to work with

#### _Redux_

üö´ Why did you choose this framework?

-    Greatly simplifies global state management
-    Versatile in its utility

#### _Material-UI_

-    Makes styling much easier, once you get past the poor documentation
-    Lets us use CSS styling in react
-    Makes it easy to make pages responsive


#### Front end deployed to `Netlify`

#### [Back end](https://github.com/Lambda-School-Labs/kansha-be) built using:

#### _Node_

-    Simpler and easier to use with Java, as its javascript.
-    Node is what the majority of us learned for our backend unit

#### _Express_

-    Very capable and full featured
-    Most of the team is familiar with Express
-    The Connect Middleware functionality makes our backend service very extensible.

#### _Knex_

-    Extremely flexible
-    Full featured schema and query builders
-    lets us switch from development to staging to production with ease.

# APIs

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ auth0

Authenticate and authorize apps and APIs with any identity provider running on any stack any device or cloud.  It is simple to integrate and allows users to just sign up with a Google account if they wish.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ S3 Bucket

Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and big data analytics.



# 3Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following:

    *  REACT_APP_REDIRECT_URI_BASE = "http://localhost:3000"
    *  REACT_APP_CLIENT_ID = "7zLELHA3Jyrt7O5M561HgBg3EjRsoT5K"
    *  REACT_APP_BASE_URL = "https://kansha-staging.herokuapp.com"
    *  REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN = "kansha.auth0.com"

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Testing

We used Jest and Enzyme to build our testing for Kansha.

# 4Ô∏è‚É£ Installation Instructions

1. Clone the repo to your drive
2. cd into the kansha/kansha-fe/react-app
3. type yarn to install the dependencies (if you use npm, it would be npm install)

## Other Scripts

    * yarn start - starts the local build of the app
    * yarn test - runs the created tests on the build
